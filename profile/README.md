# Clarkson University Rocketry Team

Clarkson University Rocketry is a student-run organization that designs, manufactures and launches high-powered rockets, competing annually in the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association's International Rocket Engineering Competition.
Clarkson Rocketry is one of fourteen Clarkson University Student Projects for Engineering Experience and Design (SPEED) teams, and are open to all students regardless of major or year.
We hold weekly general body meetings before meeting in subteams throughout the week, emulating industry engineering and project management practices.
